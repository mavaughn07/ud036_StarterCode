# Movie Trailer Website Project
This project takes **media.py** classes and generates a local webpage by running **entertainment_center.py**

## Running the program
Download **entertainment_center.py**, **media.py**, and **fresh_tomatoes.py** into the same directory. Launching **entertainment_center.py** will generate a local webpage.

## Adding another movie
Classes are in the format of `media.Movie(title, storyline, youtube url, poster url)`
Once the class is created, add your variable to the array `movies`

### Notes
* The array `movies` does not have to contain a multiple of 3 classes. (However stylistically this is ideal since all rows on the webpage will be filled and spaced evenly)
* From Lesson 9 of the Udacity Nanodegree Program
